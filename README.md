# ORIC-Diag
This is a convertion of the ORIC Diagnostic PCB located at https://oric.signal11.org.uk/html/diagrom.htm Unfortunately with EAGLE going end of life it was tough going to get the PCB orders. This is a KICAD conversion of the original, no changes made as of 7/9/25. The Gerbers are located in production/OricDiagBoard.zip and can be uploaded directly to your favourite PCB manufacturer. 

NOTE: Mike Brown is the original author of the works, I take no credit for it this is a direct conversion into Kicad only.

# Oric Repair Checklist
Again, just a conversion. This time adding the PCB images into the word doc rather than being in a separate ZIP file. All credits go to the Author MJB. Also corrected the text with the errata noted on the source web site. https://oric.signal11.org.uk/html/repairguide.htm
